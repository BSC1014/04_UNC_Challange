# 04_UNC_Challenge

## Challenge 4 solved code and written analysis available in the "solved" folder.    
 
 
Please note that section four titled "# Find the mean reading score for all students in grades 11 and 12 combined." asked for the mean reading score, but the pre populated figure was actually the math score. I left the match score hashed out and gave the code which populates the reading score per the directions.
